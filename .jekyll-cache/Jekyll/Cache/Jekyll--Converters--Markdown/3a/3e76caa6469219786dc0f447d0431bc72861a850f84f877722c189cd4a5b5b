<p>I’m opening up a blog for the project ‘Designing Multispecies Menstrual Care’, <a href="https://www.kth.se/sv/navet/research/projects/designing-multispecies-menstrual-care-1.1040991">a NAVET collaboration between KTH and Konstfack</a>. In this project we will explore the design of menstrual management technologies and services, focusing on different aspects of the experience of menstruation: the assembly and design of the products, the use, and the waste and composting of the organic materials leftover from the process.</p>
