Although it has not been a subject of scientific and clinical trials, the practice of fertilizing houseplants and domestic gardens with menstrual blood is already widespread and &lt;a href=&quot;http://peer2pickle.weebly.com/menstrual-blood-fertilizer.html&quot;&gt;well documented on social media and blogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when thinking at larger scales, at scales of mass production and consumption of plant-based food and products, of extensive crops and monoculture practices of modern-day agriculture, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that menstrual blood would be sufficient; it wouldn‚Äôt scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/menstrual-care-blog/assets/images/pouringplant4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Fertilizing houseplants with menstrual blood diluted in water&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the use of menstrual blood as a fertilizer only makes sense at local scales, where individuals are willing and are able to collect and distribute their blood to their houseplants, urban gardens or local wild flora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Would the monthly blood of one menstruating human be enough to nourish the crops that this human, or a small collective, would consume during the month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When giving a ‚Äòpractical use‚Äô like fertilizer to menstrual blood, which is commonly considered waste, and ‚Äòuseless‚Äô, one could wonder if we might we be risking turning menstrual blood into a commodity. Imagine that menstrual blood is suddenly discovered to hold the miraculous properties of organic plant nutrition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudson.org.au/latest-news/womb-to-wounds-menstrual-fluid-could-repair-damaged-skin/&quot;&gt;reparation of wounded or damaged skin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://we-make-money-not-art.com/whitefeather-hunter-the-witch-in-the-lab-coat/&quot;&gt;as a source of serum for nourishing tissue culture and possibly lab-grown meat&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ Wouldn‚Äôt it suddenly be regarded as liquid gold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/menstrual-care-blog/assets/images/mooncalf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitefeatherhunter.ca/new-research&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;WhiteFeather Hunter, Mooncalf, 2019-present&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, menstrual blood can already do all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yet menstrual blood has not been harvested and packaged away by trendy silicon-valley startups, and we are yet to imagine what a multinational-pharmaceutical-company-owned menstrual blood bank would look like. This is possibly because menstrual blood carries the enormous weight of centuries of stigma, disgust and shame. The menstrual products that currently exist in the world build on this stigma, and more broadly, on the objectification and control of marginalized bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing for the commodification of menstrual blood here; quite the opposite. I am arguing that the practices of collecting, understanding, noticing and nourishing other species with menstrual blood are acts of defiance of a capitalist system, they do not fit within a system that oppresses and enforces stigmas upon menstruating bodies. Menstrual blood as ‚Äòuseful‚Äô doesn‚Äôt fit into capitalist dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, it will be necessary to hold on to these reflections and keep them in mind when further in the design process. If we are not interested in scaling the use of menstrual blood, but focusing on local and communal practices, it is essential to consider designing a &lt;strong&gt;process or ritual&lt;/strong&gt; rather than a &lt;strong&gt;product&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.missingwitches.com/2019/10/23/witches-found-whitefeather-hunter/&quot;&gt;The making is not less important than what is made&lt;/a&gt;, and in this case, the making, the exploration of the materiality of menstrual blood, is what could be truly radical.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="reflections" /><summary type="html">Potentially, menstrual blood can act as a fertilizer for plants, due to its rich nutrient composition.

&lt;p&gt;Last fall, my friend, collaborator and moss-lover Marie Louise Juul S√∏ndergaard introduced me to the curious connections of moss and menstruation. Many of the ideas and explorations in this entry build on our conversations and shared experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/menstrual-care-blog/assets/images/IMG_1242.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sphagnum&lt;/em&gt; moss, also known as ‚Äòpeat moss‚Äô, is a variety of mosses that can hold large quantities of water inside its cells, up to 25 times its dry weight, and it can be found all over Sweden [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gbif.org/species/144105015&quot;&gt;Global Biodiversity Information Facility&lt;/a&gt;]. Because of its highly absorbent and antiseptic properties, Sphagnum moss is used as a soil conditioner in gardening, and, curiously enough, it has also been used throughout history to absorb bodily fluids. This moss has been used in many indigenous cultures as a lining and ‚Äòdisposable diaper‚Äô for infant‚Äôs cradles, or in western culture, for dressing wounds during the World Wars [&lt;em&gt;Robin Wall Kimmerer, 2003. Gathering moss: a natural and cultural history of mosses&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not surprising to find instances of the use of this moss for collecting menstrual blood, and even manufactured examples, such as a moss-filled sanitary pads that briefly circulated in the USA during 1919, named ‚ÄòSfag-na-kins‚Äô [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mum.org/sfagnak.htm&quot;&gt;SFAG-NA-KINS menstrual pad box and ads&lt;/a&gt;]. The feasibility and implications for both the environment and women‚Äôs health for using Sphagnum moss as a material for menstrual products are extremely positive [&lt;em&gt;Tracy E Roe. Sustainability, menstrual products and sphagnum moss : An investigation&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/menstrual-care-blog/assets/images/IMG_1420.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
I have tried drying sphagnum moss Marie Louise and I harvested from a forest in Stockholm last fall. I used a bamboo herb drying structure I purchased here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://robygge.se/hus-hem/orttork-torkolla-robygge/&quot;&gt;√ñrttork - Torkolla, Robygge - Hus &amp;amp; Hem - Robygge.se&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species.&lt;/em&gt; From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum&quot;&gt;Sphagnum - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Microscopic Life in Sphagnum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sphagnum moss is often used in crafting and gardening as a planting medium (for example, for orchids), for lining baskets, for seed starting, or for decorative purposes, such as the Japanese moss balls called &lt;em&gt;kokedama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/menstrual-care-blog/assets/images/kokedama%20jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knitting-sphagnum&quot;&gt;Knitting Sphagnum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial design experiment, I have attempted to knit my dried sphagnum between layers of cotton (this could be another biodegradable yarn instead). The texture of the dried moss is very powdery ‚Äîit disintegrates quickly, and therefore it might be the best kind of material to spin into fibers, or to put in direct contact with intimate areas.
These kid of patches could later be incorporated into pouches or pockets of fabric, similar to the SFAG-NA-KINS, which would be much more comfortable against the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dried moss can be regrown later by just adding water. Perhaps the nutrients in menstrual blood, acting as a fertilizer, could contribute to the growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compressed-sphagnum&quot;&gt;Compressed sphagnum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moss blocks can be purchased in gardening stores, and are often used to retain moisture in potted plants. Perhaps one could imagine a tampon made from one of these moss blocks?&lt;/p&gt;

In this project we will explore the design of menstrual management technologies and services, focusing on different aspects of the experience of menstruation: the assembly and design of the products, the use, and the waste and composting of the organic materials leftover from the process. &lt;!--more--&gt; This will result in a design proposal and a high fidelity prototype which could be a smart wearable garment produced with biobased materials, or a physical device, such as a waste bin, which enables the collection, analysis, and compost of the bodily fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
