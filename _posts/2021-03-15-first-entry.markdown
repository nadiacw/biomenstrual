I’m opening up a blog for the project ‘Designing Multispecies Menstrual Care’, [a NAVET collaboration between KTH and Konstfack](https://www.kth.se/sv/navet/research/projects/designing-multispecies-menstrual-care-1.1040991). In this project we will explore the design of menstrual management technologies and services, focusing on different aspects of the experience of menstruation: the assembly and design of the products, the use, and the waste and composting of the organic materials leftover from the process. <!--more--> This will result in a design proposal and a high fidelity prototype which could be a smart wearable garment produced with biobased materials, or a physical device, such as a waste bin, which enables the collection, analysis, and compost of the bodily fluids. 

In this blog I will describe the design process, including reflections, experiments and random thoughts.
